MiniChallenges 8 To 10

This project is made up of three controllers, one for each challenge. The Magic8Ball takes any input and returns a prediction, the GuessIt takes a number input and compares it to a random number, and the RestaurantPicker chooses a random restaurant based off an inputted category.

1/11/24: Created and built out entire project.

Peer Review: Tommy Ngo
- The code runs as intended. Tested both in Swagger and Postman. Ran multiple inputs to validate the code.  Only suggestions I would input is that in: 
- MiniChallenge 9: Validate when going outside the given array. IE 1-10 inputting 11.
- MiniChallenge 10: Since the api doesn't specify category options. Add into the invalid response to output the valid categories.
- Double check grammar/spelling errors.
- What is the callprompt used for? seems unnecessary.
