Peer Review: Tommy Ngo
- The code runs as intended. Tested both in Swagger and Postman. Ran multiple inputs to validate the code.  Only suggestions I would input is that in: 
- MiniChallenge 9: Validate when going outside the given array. IE 1-10 inputting 11.
- MiniChallenge 10: Since the api doesn't specify category options. Add into the invalid response to output the valid categories.
- Double check grammar/spelling errors.
- What is the callprompt used for? seems unnecessary.
